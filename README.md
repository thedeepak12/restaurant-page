# Restaurant Page

This project is a multi-page restaurant website built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, bundled with Webpack. It features a dynamic tabbed interface that allows users to navigate between the Home, Menu, and About sections without reloading the page. Each section is rendered programmatically with modular JavaScript, showcasing the use of DOM manipulation and modern frontend development practices.

## Features

* **Tabbed Navigation**: Seamless switching between Home, Menu, and About sections using JavaScript without page reloads.
* **Modular Components**: Each section (Home, Menu, About) is implemented as a separate JS module, promoting clean and maintainable code.
* **Dynamically Rendered Content**: Menu items, images, and descriptions are generated dynamically and updated based on user interaction.
* **Image Imports via Webpack**: Assets like images are imported and bundled properly for optimized performance.
* **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts well across different screen sizes for a consistent user experience.
* **Professional Styling**: Clean typography, interactive buttons, and section-specific layouts to simulate a polished restaurant interface.

## Tech Stack

* **JavaScript**: Used to dynamically generate and update DOM content.
* **HTML**: Base structure of the page.
* **CSS**: Custom styles using:

  * Flexbox and Grid for layout control.
  * Custom button states, active tab styling, and responsive images.
* **Webpack**: Bundles JS modules, handles asset imports (images, CSS), and allows use of modern development tooling.

## What I Learned

* **Modular JavaScript Architecture**: Gained experience in splitting code into clean, reusable modules and organizing logic effectively.
* **Webpack Configuration**: Learned how to configure Webpack for handling JS, CSS, and image files, and use loaders properly.
* **Dynamic DOM Manipulation**: Built all page content with JavaScript, reinforcing understanding of the DOM and rendering logic.
* **UI Interaction Handling**: Implemented tab switching with active states and button focus styles for better user feedback.
* **Semantic HTML & Accessible UI**: Focused on clean markup and professional, accessible design patterns.
